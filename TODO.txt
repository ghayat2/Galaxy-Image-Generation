TODO:

-  Create similar GAN to base GAN with conditional input on the generator being the label of the image we want to compare it to

- Implement Image Preprocessing further in the ImageDataGenerator parameters/preprocessing function

- Work on checkpointing and get a clear checkpointing technique for both the generation and scoring parts
